# DigiExam-c-p-poc
DigiExam clears your clipboard before entering lockdown mode(maby spamms it in lockdown aswell)

I got this id√© while looking through the imports of DigiExam and noticed how they cleared the clipboard.
This is only a POC becuase i dont know if it actually works. 

A pic of how DigiExam does it. Just xref OpenClipBoard in IDA and you will find it yourself.
