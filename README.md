# DigiExam-c-p-poc
DigiExam clears your clipboard before entering lockdown mode(maby spamms it in lockdown aswell)

I got this id√© while looking through the imports of DigiExam and noticed how they cleared the clipboard.
This is only a POC becuase i dont know if it actually works.  It is buggy and it might take a few tries before it actually pasted.
I recommend to hold down ctrl + v for 10 sec and if that does not worrk try again a few times.

This prob does not work on digiexam since they dont have the clipboard open etc.
